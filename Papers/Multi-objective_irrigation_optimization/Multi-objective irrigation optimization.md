We propose a machine learning approach based on the crop simulation model WOFOST to assess the crop yield and water use eÔ¨Éciency. In our research, we use weather history to evaluate various weather scenarios. The application of multi-criteria optimization based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) allows users to Ô¨Ånd the dates and volume of water for irrigation, maximizing the yield and reducing the total water consumption. In the study case, we compared the eÔ¨Äectiveness of NSGA-II with Monte Carlo search and a real farmer‚Äôs strategy. We showed a decrease in water consumption simultaneously with increased sugar-beet yield using the NSGA-II algorithm. Our app-roach yielded a higher potato crop than a farmer with a similar level of water consumption. The NSGA-II algorithm received an increase in yield for potato crops, but water use eÔ¨Éciency remained at the farmer‚Äôs level.NSGA-II used water resources more eÔ¨Éciently than the Monte Carlo search and reduced water losses to the lower soil horizons.
