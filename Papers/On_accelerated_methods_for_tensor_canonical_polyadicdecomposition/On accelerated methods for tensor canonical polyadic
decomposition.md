We present Nesterov acceleration techniques for alternating least squares (ALS) methods applied to canonical tensor decomposition. The tensor decomposition problem is nonconvex. Thus, for convergence guarantee, we use a certain version of the Nesterov acceleration by adding a momentum term with a specific weight sequence determined by onedimensional search.
